# Analyzing Copy Number Variation in Common Cancer Groups
For my COMP 561: Computational Biology Methods and Research class, I analyzed copy number variations from common cancer groups
to find the most highly variable regions on the chromosome. The data was taken from Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC).
Using Manhatten distance for determining the differences in copy number, we computed a score for variability at each position
for which a gene was known to be involved with a cancer group. Unfortunately, as part of our conclusion, we realized that
the dataset was rather inadequate in sample size for us to sufficiently conclude which regions were highy variable.
